RANGED & MELEE SHARED RESOLUTION:
Roll Ranged Attack Die: 1d4
Compare vs Target's Current Armor Value
NEW Armor system: [AP] = [ARMOR PLATES]. Depending on your class or bonuses you recieve from cards or allies, you gain [ARMOR PLATES]. When an attack hits you, the attack goes against your [ARMOR VALUE]. If the attack meets, or beats your [ARMOR VALUE], it does FULL DAMAGE, piercing right through the armor to your HP but your [ARMOR VALUE] does not decrease. If it gets LESS THAN your current [ARMOR VALUE], then you deduct -1 from your [ARMOR VALUE] and recieve no damage as the armor received it for you. All of this is visible on the characters [PROFILE]. 

To use a [RANGED] Attack, you must have a [RANGED WEAPON] equipped. If you have a [RANGED WEAPON] you have 4 [BULLET TOKENS], represented in the top right of your [PROFILE]. These represent your Bullets. After you use all of your bullets, you must [RELOAD] as an action if you wish to use it again. Because you're using a [JUNK WEAPON - TIER I], reloading damages the weapon. The total health for all [JUNK RANGED WEPAONS] weapons is 4 GP [GUN POINTS]. Everytime you reload it does 1d4 damage to the weapon itself, unless you have a Class/card ability that says otherwise. Once the [RANGED WEAPON] reaches 0 GP, it must be repaired in order to use it again. By default, it takes one [JUNK MATERIAL] to [repair] one[ GUN POINT] on the gun.

[JUNK MATERIAL] - Is a material that can be found in the UTILITY card deck. You do NOT have to discard the other card if a JUNK card is drawn. You can exchange it for a JUNK TOKEN, then add ithe card back to the bottom of the UTILITY deck. You can use as many JUNK TOKENS as you wish to [REPAIR] ONE item. 1 [JUNK TOKEN] = +1 to item. So if you have 3 JUNK TOKENS, you can repair either your [ARMOR PLATES] or a [JUNK WEAPON] for 3 HP or 3 Plates. [JUnk TOKENS] are displayed on your [PROFILE].
